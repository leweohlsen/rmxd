# rmxd

## What's rmxd?
rmxd uses the SoundCloud API to give you the best remixes from any of the [Billboard Chart Lists](http://www.billboard.com/charts). It's build with Python, Flask and Bootstrap.

## Getting started

As of 20th of August 2016, rmxd is against the [SoundCloud-API ToS](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use#changes).
> […] you must not use the SoundCloud® API to create any kind of alternative digital content service, including: any service that aggregates and streams User Content from multiple users into an on-demand listening service, or any playback experience which aggregates and streams User Content with content from other services (e.g. SoundCloud with YouTube)

Consequently, please use rmxd only for personal purposes.
