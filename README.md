# rmxd

## What's rmxd?
rmxd uses the SoundCloud API and guoguo12's [billboard.py](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts) to give you the best remixes from any of the [Billboard Chart Lists](http://www.billboard.com/charts). It's build with Python, Flask and Bootstrap.

## Disclamier

As of 20th of August 2016, rmxd is against the [SoundCloud-API ToS](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use#changes).

> […] you must not use the SoundCloud® API to create any kind of alternative digital content service, including: any service that aggregates and streams User Content from multiple users into an on-demand listening service, or any playback experience which aggregates and streams User Content with content from other services (e.g. SoundCloud with YouTube)

Consequently, please use rmxd for personal purposes only.

## Getting started

* make sure you have Python and Flask installed
* install SoundCloud and Billboard API

``` 
pip install soundcloud
pip install billboard.py 
```

* paste your soundcloud api key into rmxd.py

* launch rmxd

``` python rmxd.py```

* rmxd is now running on localhost:5000
